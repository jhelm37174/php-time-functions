/*
Notes on this function:
______________________________________________________________________________
This script uses the ISO standard numeric assignment for days - 0 = sunday and 
6 = saturday so we assume counting 1-5.

The idea here is to split the date range in to individual days - first day 
(timeOne date) starting at 00:00 and end day (timeTwo date) ending at 23:59

We can then look at each day through an array, and apply logic to count. 
Note that all calculations are using seconds - not other units!
